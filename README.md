# IFC-Cost-Item-Validation
Case study and useful outputs for the preparation of the paper developed to validate the BIM model containing cost information (IfcCostItem)

This study presents a new framework within the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model to organize cost elements systematically, moving away from the current unstructured approach. It involves defining a dedicated cost domain in IFC, exploring its connections with geometric information models, and validating these connections through semi-automated checks. A case study on a structural IFC model is conducted to evaluate its practical applications. Additionally, guidelines for BIM information requirements will be established via the Information Delivery Specification (IDS) to ensure clarity for both human users and computer systems. These guidelines will specify the necessary data components for validating the uniqueness of associated cost data within the geometric model. Overall, the study demonstrates the feasibility of structured cost element definition within IFC, enhancing coherence and accuracy in cost estimation.
